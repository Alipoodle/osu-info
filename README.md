## Install
To get the latest version go to https://github.com/GreenTurtwig/osu-info/releases and downlaod the latest `osuinfoSetup.msi`.  
  
When you first run the installer SmartScreen might pop up and tell you the program might put your PC at risk, don't worry it won't. :-)  
You can just click "More info" and then "Run anyway" to start the installer.

After the installer has finished osu!info should *hopefully* be installed on your computer!  
  
You can download the latest version from the [releases](https://github.com/GreenTurtwig/osu-info/releases) page and run the newest installer to update to the latest version.
  
  
When osu!info has been installed it should ask you for an API key on first startup, you can get one from the osu! website [here](https://osu.ppy.sh/p/api).

## Bugs/Issues
If you encounter any bugs or issues you can report them on GitHub [here](https://github.com/GreenTurtwig/osu-info/issues) or *possibly* get help in the [Gitter chat](https://gitter.im/GreenTurtwig/osu-info).  
  
If osu!info doesn't run then try deativating your antivirus and run again. I've personally had problems with it not running with Avast. :-(
